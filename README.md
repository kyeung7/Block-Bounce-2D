# Program Description:
We created a game called "Block Bounce." This game is a siderunner in which there is a block that the user controls to 
jump over obstacles. When the game is launched, the user is presented with a welcome message to the game and an option to 
move to a help screen. Otherwise, the user can hit enter to start the game. When playing the game the user has a health 
bar, seen in the bottom. As the user's block hits an object, health is taken away and the game is over when the user is 
out of health. Upon the end of the game the user is shown their score from the game, and how it compares to the high 
score from others who've played the game. Another feature is that the game can be played during night or day. 

# Directions:
- To test, launch the program, this will bring you to our start screen. 
- From here you can enter the help screen by clicking 'h' or begin the game by hitting 'enter'
- The game will last as long as you can maneuver the objects with the space bar and don't run out of health
- Note that during the game you can switch the scenery (day or night) with the arrow keys
- When the game is over, you will be brought to the end screen where you will see how your score compares to high score
of others who've used the application.
